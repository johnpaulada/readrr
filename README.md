A speed reading thing I built for myself. You can use it too if you want.

## Instructions
Just add the text you want to read and then press the Start button. It will display each word in text you added.

## Rationale
When you focus on the words and something is quickly displaying those words for you, you realize you can actually read pretty fast and can cover a lot of text much faster than you usually would.
